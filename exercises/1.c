// To do this, make sure you're in the `exercises` directory, and then run:

// gcc -o app1 1.c && ./app1

    // ðŸ‘‰ Try making the length much longer than 14, like 200. What happens? ðŸ˜±

    //    (You'll want to change the length of write() above back to 14 first!)
    // ðŸ‘‰ Try adding a second number, named num2. Set it to something other than 42.

    //    immediately after the program finishes running.)
